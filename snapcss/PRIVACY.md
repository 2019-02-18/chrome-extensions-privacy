# Privacy Policy — SnapCSS

**Last updated: April 9, 2026**

## Overview

SnapCSS is a Chrome browser extension that allows developers and designers to inspect CSS styles of web page elements. This privacy policy explains how SnapCSS handles your data.

## Data Collection

**SnapCSS does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers.**

Specifically:

- **No analytics** — We do not use any analytics or tracking services
- **No user data storage** — We do not store browsing history, page content, or any form of personal information
- **No first-party servers** — SnapCSS does not operate any backend services

## Data Usage

The extension only accesses the following browser APIs for its core functionality:

- **`activeTab`** — To inspect CSS styles on the currently active tab when you activate inspect mode
- **`scripting`** — To inject the inspection overlay into web pages
- **`storage`** — To save your local preferences (theme choice, copy format, language) using `chrome.storage.sync`, and AI configuration using `chrome.storage.local`. These preferences are stored locally in your browser profile and never transmitted to any SnapCSS server
- **`contextMenus`** — To add an "Inspect with SnapCSS" option to the right-click menu

## Local Preferences

SnapCSS stores the following user preferences locally via Chrome's built-in storage API:

- Copy format preference (Standard CSS / CSS Variables / Minified)
- Theme preference (System / Light / Dark)
- Language preference (System Default / English / Chinese)

These settings sync across your Chrome instances through Chrome's own sync mechanism if you have Chrome Sync enabled. SnapCSS has no access to or control over Chrome Sync.

## AI Configuration (Optional)

If you choose to use the AI analysis feature, SnapCSS stores the following in `chrome.storage.local` (local only, not synced):

- AI provider selection (OpenAI / Claude / Gemini / Custom)
- API Key (encrypted by Chrome's built-in storage)
- Custom endpoint URL (if applicable)
- Model name

**Important:** Your API Key is stored only in your local browser profile and is never sent to any SnapCSS server.

## CSS Data

When you inspect an element, SnapCSS reads its computed CSS styles using the browser's standard `window.getComputedStyle()` API. This CSS data:

- Is only displayed in the floating panel on your screen
- Is only copied to your clipboard when you explicitly click "Copy"
- Is discarded as soon as you close the panel or deactivate inspect mode

### AI Analysis Data Flow

When you use the AI analysis feature (optional, requires user-provided API Key):

- CSS data is sent **only** to the AI provider endpoint you have configured (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, or your custom endpoint)
- Data is sent **only** when you explicitly click an AI action button (Explain, Optimize, Responsive) or submit a question
- SnapCSS does not intercept, log, or store any data sent to or received from the AI provider
- The AI provider's own privacy policy applies to data processed by their API
- No CSS data is ever sent to any SnapCSS server

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this document.
